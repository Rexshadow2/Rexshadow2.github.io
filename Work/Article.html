    <h1>Bingo Drive Set To Begin Next Week!</h1>

    <p>The Bingo Drive for the High school will be set to begin on <b>Tuesday, Febuary 4th </b>. Each ticket will cost $10 each and order forms can be found at the office or printed out online. Forms are due by the end of the month. The physical tickets will be given to the sellers 2 weeks after the drive ends.</p>

    <h2>Our goal with this drive.</h2>
    
    <p> The bingo drive has been a long lasting tradition of our school district dating back to the 1980s when the school first started out. Over the years, we have raised over $500k for various charities around our city. One of the charities has told us that they <q>love the kids' passion with selling the tickets and appreciate how much they make to help others.</q></p>
    
    <h2>A special announcement from the student council president</h2>
    
    <p>
    Hey guys! This year the school is looking into trying to do something special is we raise enough money to break the school's record this year. If we raise
    over $10,245, we will get a special prize that will be announced in an assembly the day the drive begins. So tell your friends and family about it and lets sell as many tickets as we can!.
